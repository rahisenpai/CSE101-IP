Advantages of using OO
1.It makes working with complex objects easy.
2.It makes code easy to understand and organised.

Advantages of using Dictionaries
1.It is faster than OO.
2.It is memory efficient. 


Disadvantage of using OO
1.It is slower than dictionary.
2.It takes up more memory.

Disadvantage of using dictionaries
1.It requires careful choice of data structure.
2.It may require bit more logic.


Performance comparison for grading operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two approaches in seconds, and which is faster and by how much).
1. N: 10000
2. Time by OO: 15.28
3. Time by dictionary: 3.14
4. X is faster; fraction of time x took is: 0.205

Performance comparison for search operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two approaches in seconds, and which is faster and by how much).
1. N: 1000000
2. Time by OO: 1.4
3. Time by dictionary: 0.09
4. X is faster; fraction of time x took is: 0.064
